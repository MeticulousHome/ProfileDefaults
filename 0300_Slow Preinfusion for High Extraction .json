    "description": "Achieves high extraction with a super slow pre-infusion. Begins with an extended preinfusion phase at very low flow as defined by the 'Preinfusion Flow' variable, allowing the puck to slowly and evenly saturate.\n\nAfter the pre-infusion, the pressure gradually increases to the set 'Target Pressure' for the main extraction phase. This controlled ramp-up helps to extract the full spectrum of flavors from the coffee.\n\n\nDial in a flow rate of 0.5 to 1.0 ml/s during pre-infusion, with a smooth transition to 1.5 to 2.0 ml/s during the main extraction. Expect to grind very to extremely fine"
