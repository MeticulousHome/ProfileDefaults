    "shortDescription": "Fast extraction with courser ground coffee and long contact times",
    "description": "Immediately ramps-up to high pressure, bypassing the traditional pre-infusion phase. This rapid increase in pressure quickly saturates the coffee puck and initiates the extraction process almost instantly.\n\nStudies have shown that this method enhances sweetness and clarity, providing a bright and bold extraction.\n\nOften preserves the acidity despite the long extraction ratio.\n\nDial in a flow rate of 2.0 to 4.0 ml/s during the extraction. Use the 'Flow Limit' Variable to prevent absolute gushers."
